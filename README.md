# sRS
sub Reddit scraper

sRS is actually hosted on OpenShift. You can find it here: http://osrs-rioht.rhcloud.com

sRS is a webapplication written in Python. It uses Flask to host and serve web pages,
PRAW to connect to and scrape Reddit, and Bootstrap to style the pages.

It's still in pretty early stages and needs some serious clean up in how it presents information
but is actually quite functional.

Cheers,

Dave
